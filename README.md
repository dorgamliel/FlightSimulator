**Milestone description:** In this milestone, the main focus is building a desktop app, which communicates with a dummy server (mimics the actual simulator's behavoir).
, a detailed dashboard with real-time plane data.

**What is included?**
This app consists of three main components:
1. Controllers - Controlling the plane is now simple with navigation controllers, including throttle, aileron, elevator and rudder
2. Dashbaord - a detailed dashboard with real-time plane data.
3. Map - A map (powered by Bing Maps) which shows current location of the plane, and updates regularly it's location on the map.
Combining these three main components (and some extra tweaks), this app is whole and reliable.


**An important remark:** As written above, this project is in the making. All of the description above relates to the current milestone.
